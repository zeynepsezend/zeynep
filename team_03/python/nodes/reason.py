"""
nodes/reason.py — LLM reasoning node: decides what to do next each turn.

The reason node is the brain of the agent. It reads the full conversation
history (including all tool results so far) and decides whether to:
  - Place an object  → sets object_to_place, routes to add_objects
  - Call a tool      → sets pending_tool_calls, routes to tools.py
  - Finish           → sets final_response, ends the current loop

No Rhino. No MCP calls. Pure LLM inference.
