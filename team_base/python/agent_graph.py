# agent_graph.py — The "brain" of the AI agent
# =============================================================================
#
# WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
#   This file defines how the AI agent thinks and acts. The agent follows a
#   simple loop:
#
#     1. REASON  — The AI reads your question and the list of available tools,
#                  then decides what to do next: either call a tool or give a
#                  final answer.
#
#     2. TOOL    — If the AI decided to call a tool, this step runs that tool
#                  (e.g. a Grasshopper calculation) and hands the result back
#                  to the AI so it can keep going.
#
#     3. REPEAT  — Steps 1–2 repeat until the AI has everything it needs to
#                  give a complete final answer.
#
#   The structure of this loop is called a "graph" (hence the filename). The
#   graph is built with a library called LangGraph.
#
# KEY PIECES YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHANGE:
#
#   SYSTEM_PROMPT (in nodes/reason_node.py)
#     This is the instruction sheet the AI reads before every conversation.
#     Change this text to give the AI a different personality, more specific
#     rules, or a different output format. For example:
#       - "Always respond in bullet points."
#       - "You are an expert structural engineer assistant."
#       - "Return results as a JSON object."
#
#   max_iterations (passed in from main.py)
#     This is the maximum number of tool calls the agent is allowed to make
#     before it is forced to stop. Raise it if your task needs many tool calls;
#     lower it to keep things fast and cheap.
#
#   route_after_reason (in nodes/route_after_reason.py)
#     This is the decision function that chooses which step comes next in the
#     graph. If you wanted the agent to do something different after calling a
#     tool — for example, a validation step before looping back — you would
#     add a new node and wire it in here.
#
#   Adding a new node
#     To add a new step to the agent loop (e.g. a "summarize" step after the
#     final answer), you would:
#       1. Write a new function like `def summarize_node(state): ...`
#       2. Register it:  graph.add_node("summarize", summarize_node)
#       3. Wire it in:   graph.add_edge("reason", "summarize")
#                        graph.add_edge("summarize", END)
